      NOTE:  By default, no user is included in the "manager-gui" role required

      you must define such a user - the username and password are arbitrary. It is
      strongly recommended that you do NOT use one of the users in the commented out
      section below since they are intended for use with the examples web

      examples web application, do not forget to remove the <!.. ..> that surrounds
      them. You will also need to set the passwords to something appropriate.
